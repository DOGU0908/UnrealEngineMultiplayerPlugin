# Unreal Engine Multiplayer Plugin

This project focuses on developing a reusable multiplayer feature for Unreal Engine 5.3. The plugin allows players to host and join sessions via LAN connection or Steam. By creating a plugin that encapsulates the multiplayer functionality, other projects can easily import it and configure the DefaultEngine.ini file in the Config folder to start utilizing these features.

## Features
- Host and Join Sessions: Players can host and join multiplayer sessions over LAN or Steam.
- Reusability: The multiplayer functionalities are encapsulated in a plugin, making it easy to integrate to other projects.
- Easy Configuration: Simply import the plugin and set up the DefaultEngine.ini to get started.
